Procedures

 - User can define procedures, with access to channels
    e.g. "if channel goes over this value, do X"
 - Idea: Drop down combobox w/ channels, put in max/min values
 - Idea: Pop up screen with active channels and variable names, example script, user writes simple if statements

Error Handling

 - Between raspberry pi and gui, between raspberry pi and devices
    currently sends back ERR[0-9]
 - Timeouts between GUI and raspberry pi, if arduino goes offline
    Displaying polling rate in GUI, falls back to polling rate of slowest arduino

General

 - Front page overview, can set overview present when channel is created
 - Decide which panels we want on the front page, currently everything is on the front page
 - Python3 ready
 - Move to QT?

USB

 - Driver for new power supply

Arduino

 - Arduino IDE installed, go to libraries folder, create a folder for the communications library
    Create a symlink to libraries folder
 - Test Arduino using serial plotter from Arduino IDE
 - Has a function for querying value of specific channel, and listing channels available
    sends 'i' or 'c', sends back list of channel names, use to determine which channels to fill
