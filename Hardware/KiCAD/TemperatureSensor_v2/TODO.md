 - The Arduino footprint is slightly too wide. This
   should be narrowed by ~0.5 mm.

 - Test pads should be added around each MAX controller
   and probably the voltage regulator.

 - The labelling can be improved. The capacitors and MAXs
   have difficult-to-follow numberings. The SDO pin is
   missing a label.

 - The thermocouple footprint pads are too close together.
   These should be extended by ~0.5mm.

 - The solder pads for the thermocouple connectors are too
   small. These should be extended by ~0.5mm.
