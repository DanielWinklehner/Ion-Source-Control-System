Arduino:
1) Implement query / set.
X) Move String to Character.
X) Implement object prototype so that we don't have to copy/paste similar set / get functions for the Communication class.
X) Some pre-defined functions, like a dummy function, simple on/off (set 1 pin to High / Low). Put these in the library. For both input and output.

c) Generic Arduino code. Set all the pins to different values and output those. Helps figure out which pins are not working. PWMs and Analog stuff.

Server:
2) The server already knows if the output of a query is going to be > 128 bytes. So, if that's going to happen, the server should return an error.

Once (1) is done, server + GUI so that we at least have a working version of the entire setup.


If precision for any one of the channels queried (among multiple channels), then return ERROR for the entire operation. Abort everything and just return error.

Version 3 => Subfolders for each of the arduinos and put the new codes there. Make a subfolder for power supply but do not change anything for it.

Order to move the Arduino code to use new library:
a) Sensor Box
b) Interlock Box
c) Ion Gauge Controller
