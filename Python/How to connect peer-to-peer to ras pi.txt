The Raspberry Pi needs to have a static IP set on it. For this document, let's assume it's 10.77.0.3

On your computer:

1) Disable WiFi
2) Set up static IP for your computer as well. Set it to: 10.77.0.1. Set the netmask to 255.255.0.0 and the gateway to 10.77.0.1 (or whatever static IP you have set your computer's address to).
3) Ping the IP of the Pi to see if it responds.
4) SSH.
